// :description: Understand how {es-serverless} differs from Elastic Cloud Hosted and self-managed offerings.
// :keywords: serverless, elasticsearch

<<what-is-elasticsearch-serverless,{es-serverless}>> handles all the infrastructure management for you, providing a fully managed {es} service.

If you've used {es} before, you'll notice some differences in how you work with the service on {serverless-full}, because a number of APIs and settings are not required for serverless projects.

This guide helps you understand what's different, what's available, and how to work effectively when running {es} on {serverless-full}.

[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-infrastructure-management]]
== Fully managed infrastructure

{es-serverless} manages all infrastructure automatically, including:

* Cluster scaling and optimization
* Node management and allocation
* Shard distribution and replication
* Resource utilization and monitoring

This fully managed approach means many traditional {es} infrastructure APIs and settings are not available to end users, as detailed in the following sections.

[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-apis-availability]]
== API availability

Because {es-serverless} manages infrastructure automatically, certain APIs are not available, while others remain fully accessible.

[TIP]
====
Refer to the https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch-serverless[{es-serverless} API reference] for a complete list of available APIs.
====

The following categories of operations are unavailable:

Infrastructure operations::
* All `_nodes/*` operations 
* All `_cluster/*` operations
* Most `_cat/*` operations, except for index-related operations such as `/_cat/indices` and `/_cat/aliases`

Storage and backup::
* All `_snapshot/*` operations
* Repository management operations

Index management:: 
* `indices/close` operations
* `indices/open` operations
* Recovery and stats operations
* Force merge operations

When attempting to use an unavailable API, you'll receive a clear error message:

[source,json]
----
{
 "error": {
   "root_cause": [
     {
       "type": "api_not_available_exception",
       "reason": "Request for uri [/<API_ENDPOINT>] with method [<METHOD>] exists but is not available when running in serverless mode"
     }
   ],
   "status": 410
 }
}

[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-settings-availability]]  
== Settings availability

In {es-serverless}, you can only configure {ref}/index-modules.html#index-modules-settings[index-level settings].
Cluster-level settings and node-level settings are not required by end users and the `elasticsearch.yml` file is fully managed by Elastic.

Available settings::
*Index-level settings*: Settings that control how {es} documents are processed, stored, and searched are available to end users. These include:
* Analysis configuration
* Mapping parameters
* Search/query settings
* Indexing settings such as `refresh_interval`

Managed settings::
*Infrastructure-related settings*: Settings that affect cluster resources or data distribution are not available to end users. These include:
* Node configurations
* Cluster topology
* Shard allocation
* Resource management

[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-feature-categories]]
== Feature availability

Some features that are available in Elastic Cloud Hosted and self-managed offerings are not available in {es-serverless}.
These features have either been replaced by a new feature, are planned to be released in future, or are not applicable in the new serverless architecture.

[discrete]
[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-features-replaced]]
=== Replaced features

These features have been replaced by a new feature and are therefore not available on {es-serverless}:

* *Index lifecycle management ({ilm-init})* is not available, in favor of <<index-management,**data stream lifecycle**>>.
+
In an Elastic Cloud Hosted or self-managed environment, {ilm-init} lets you automatically transition indices through data tiers according to your
performance needs and retention requirements. This allows you to balance hardware costs with performance. {es-serverless} eliminates this
complexity by optimizing your cluster performance for you.
+
Data stream lifecycle is an optimized lifecycle tool that lets you focus on the most common lifecycle management needs, without unnecessary
hardware-centric concepts like data tiers.
+
* *Watcher* is not available, in favor of <<rules-alerts, *Alerts*>>.
+
Kibana Alerts allows rich integrations across use cases like APM, metrics, security, and uptime. Prepackaged rule types simplify setup and
hide the details of complex, domain-specific detections, while providing a consistent interface across Kibana.

[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-feature-planned]]
=== Planned features

The following features are planned for future support in all {serverless-full} projects:

* Reindexing from remote clusters 
* Cross-project search and replication
* Snapshot and restore
* Migrations from non-serverless deployments
* Audit logging
* Authentication realms (native/SAML/OIDC/Kerberos/JWT)
* Clone index API
* Traffic filtering and VPCs

The following {es-serverless} project-specific features are planned for future support:

* {ref}/behavioral-analytics-overview.html[Behavioral Analytics]
* {ref}/search-application-overview.html[Search Applications]
* {enterprise-search-ref}/crawler.html[Managed web crawler]
+ 
You can use the https://github.com/elastic/crawler[self-managed web crawler] in the meantime.
+
* {ref}/es-native-connectors.html[Elastic managed Search connectors]
+ 
You can use {ref}/es-build-connector.html[self-managed Search connectors] in the meantime.

[[elasticsearch-differences-serverless-feature-unavailable]]
=== Unplanned features

* https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/hadoop/current/reference.html[{es} for Apache Hadoop]
