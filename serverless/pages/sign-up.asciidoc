== What is included in my trial?

Your free 14-day trial includes:

**One hosted deployment**

A deployment lets you explore Elastic solutions for Search, Observability, and Security. Trial deployments run on the latest version of the Elastic Stack. They includes 8 GB of RAM spread out over two availability zones, and enough storage space to get you started. If you’re looking to evaluate a smaller workload, you can scale down your trial deployment.
Each deployment includes Elastic features such as Maps, SIEM, machine learning, advanced security, and much more. You have some sample data sets to play with and tutorials that describe how to add your own data.

To learn more about serverless Elastic Cloud Hosted, check our https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started.html[Elasticsearch Service documentation].

**One serverless project**

Serverless projects package Elastic Stack features by type of solution:

* <<what-is-elasticsearch-serverless,{es}>>
* <<what-is-observability-serverless,Observability>>
* <<what-is-security-serverless,Security>>

When you create a project, you select the project type applicable to your use case, so only the relevant and impactful applications and features are easily accessible to you.

[NOTE]
====
During the trial period, you are limited to one active hosted deployment and one active serverless project at a time. When you subscribe, you can create additional deployments and projects.
