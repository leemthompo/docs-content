Got a project you no longer need and don't want to be charged for? Simply delete it.

Warning: All data is lost. Billing for usage is by the hour and any outstanding charges for usage before you deleted the project will still appear on your next bill.

To stop being charged for a project:

. Log in to the {ess-console}[{ess-console-name}].
. Find your project on the home page in the **Serverless Projects** card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Serverless Projects** to go to the projects page to view all of your projects.
. Select **Actions**, then select **Delete project** and confirm the deletion.
