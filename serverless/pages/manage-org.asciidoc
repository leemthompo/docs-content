An **organization** is the umbrella for all of your {ecloud} resources, including hosted deployments and serverless projects, users, and account settings. When you sign up to {ecloud}, you create an organization.

In this article we walk you through the essential processes to effectively oversee your organization.

Learn how to:

* <<general-manage-access-to-organization>>: Invite users in your organization to access serverless projects and specify their roles.
* <<general-assign-user-roles>>: Assign predefined roles to users in your organization.
* <<general-join-organization-from-existing-cloud-account>>: Join a new organization and bring over your projects.
* <<general-leave-an-organization>>: Leave an organization.

[[general-assign-user-roles-organization-level-roles]]
=== Organization-level roles

* **Organization owner**. Can manage all roles under the organization and has full access to all serverless projects, organization-level details, billing details, and subscription levels. This role is assigned by default to the person who created the organization.
* **Billing admin**. Has access to all invoices and payment methods. Can make subscription changes.

[[general-assign-user-roles-instance-access-roles]]
=== Instance access roles

Each serverless project type has a set of predefined roles that you can assign to your organization members.
You can assign the predefined roles:

* globally, for all projects of the same type ({es-serverless}, {observability}, or {elastic-sec}). In this case, the role will also apply to new projects created later.
* individually, for specific projects only. To do that, you have to set the **Role for all** field of that specific project type to **None**.

For example, you can assign a user the developer role for a specific {es-serverless} project:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/individual-role.png[Individual role]

ifdef::serverlessCustomRoles[]

You can also optionally <<custom-roles,create custom roles in a project>>.
To assign a custom role to users, go to "Instance access roles" and select it from the list under the specific project it was created in.
