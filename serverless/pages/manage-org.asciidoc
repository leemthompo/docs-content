[[general-assign-user-roles-instance-access-roles]]
=== Instance access roles

Each serverless project type has a set of predefined roles that you can assign to your organization members.
You can assign the predefined roles:

* globally, for all projects of the same type ({es-serverless}, {observability}, or {elastic-sec}). In this case, the role will also apply to new projects created later.
* individually, for specific projects only. To do that, you have to set the **Role for all** field of that specific project type to **None**.

For example, you can assign a user the developer role for a specific {es-serverless} project:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/individual-role.png[Individual role]

ifdef::serverlessCustomRoles[]

You can also optionally <<custom-roles,create custom roles in a project>>.
To assign a custom role to users, go to "Instance access roles" and select it from the list under the specific project it was created in.
