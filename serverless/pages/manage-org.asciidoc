When you sign up to Elastic Cloud, you create an **organization**.

This organization is the umbrella for all of your Elastic Cloud resources, users, and account settings. Every organization has a unique identifier. Bills are invoiced according to the billing contact and details that you set for your organization.

In this article we walk you through the essential processes to effectively oversee your organization.

* <<general-manage-access-to-organization>>: Invite users in your organization to access serverless projects and specify their roles.

* <<general-join-organization-from-existing-cloud-account>>: Join a new organization and bring over your projects.
* <<general-leave-an-organization>>: Leave an organization.

[[general-assign-user-roles-organization-level-roles]]
=== Organization-level roles

* **Organization owner**. Can manage all roles under the organization and has full access to all serverless projects, organization-level details, billing details, and subscription levels. This role is assigned by default to the person who created the organization.
* **Billing admin**. Has access to all invoices and payment methods. Can make subscription changes.

[[general-assign-user-roles-instance-access-roles]]
=== Instance access roles

Each serverless project type has a set of predefined roles that you can assign to your organization members.
You can assign the predefined roles:

* globally, for all projects of the same type ({es-serverless}, {observability}, or {elastic-sec}). In this case, the role will also apply to new projects created later.
* individually, for specific projects only. To do that, you have to set the **Role for all** field of that specific project type to **None**.

For example, you can assign a user the developer role for a specific {es-serverless} project:

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/individual-role.png[Individual role]

ifdef::serverlessCustomRoles[]

You can also optionally <<custom-roles,create custom roles in a project>>.
To assign a custom role to users, go to "Instance access roles" and select it from the list under the specific project it was created in.
