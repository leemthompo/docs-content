= Get started

There are two options to create serverless projects:

* If you are an existing customer, https://cloud.elastic.co/login[log in to Elastic Cloud]. On the home page, you will see a new option to create serverless projects. Note that if you are already subscribed to Elastic Cloud, there is no specific trial for serverless projects.
* If you are a new user, you can https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration[sign up for a free 14-day trial], and you will be able to launch a serverless project. For more information about the trial see, <<general-sign-up-trial-what-is-included-in-my-trial,What is included in my trial?>>.

Choose the type of project that matches your needs and we'll help you get started with our solution guides.
